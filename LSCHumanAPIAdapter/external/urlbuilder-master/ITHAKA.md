    When you start on the way to Ithaca,
    wish that the way be long,
    full of adventure, full of knowledge.
    The Laestrygones and the Cyclopes
    and angry Poseidon, do not fear:
    such, on your way, you shall never meet
    if your thoughts are lofty, if a noble
    emotion touch your mind, your body.
    The Laestrygones and the Cyclopes
    and angry Poseidon you shall not meet
    if you carry them not in your soul,
    if your soul sets them not up before you.

    Wish that the way be long,
    that on many summer mornings,
    with great pleasure, great delight,
    you enter harbours for the first time seen;
    that you stop at Phoenician marts,
    and procure the goodly merchandise,
    mother-of-pearl and corals, amber and ebony,
    and sensual perfumes of all kinds,
    plenty of sensual perfumes especially;
    to wend your way to many Egyptian cities,
    to learn and yet to learn from the wise.

    Ever keep Ithaca in your mind,
    your return thither is your goal.
    But do not hasten at all your voyage,
    better that it last for many years;
    And full of years at length you anchor at your isle
    rich with all that you gained on the way;
    do not expect Ithaca to give you riches.

    Ithaca gave you your fair voyage.
    Without her you would not have ventured on the way.
    But she has no more to give you.

    And if you find Ithaca a poor place,
         she has not mocked you.
    You have become so wise, so full of experience
    that you should understand already what
         these Ithacas mean.
